# UberDataAnalyticsProject
1. Trip Analysis and Trend Identification
Objective: Analyze Uber's trip data to identify patterns and trends in ride requests, customer behavior, and operational performance.

Steps:

Collect data from available datasets like Uberâ€™s public datasets or using APIs.
Analyze trip duration, distance, fare, and customer ratings.
Identify trends such as peak hours, popular routes, and high-demand areas.
Visualize trends with charts and graphs (e.g., heat maps, time series).
Predict peak hours and suggest operational adjustments (like surge pricing or more drivers in specific locations).
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Tableau/Power BI.

2. Demand Forecasting and Surge Pricing
Objective: Build a model to predict demand for Uber rides based on historical data and suggest pricing adjustments for surge pricing.

Steps:

Collect historical data on trip requests, ride volume, time of day, and weather conditions.
Analyze correlations between demand spikes and factors like time, weather, traffic conditions, and events.
Use machine learning (e.g., time series analysis, regression, or decision trees) to predict ride demand.
Implement a surge pricing model based on predicted demand.
Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost), TensorFlow/Keras (for more advanced models), Jupyter Notebooks.
